<b>How do I install this modpack?</b>
<p><ul>
  <li>Download Prism Launcher. <i>(It's what I prefer to use.)</i> It automates the process and is kind of required with the filetype used to upload the modpack.</li>
  <li>Download the modpack file <i>(Lena and Dylan Funtims.mrpack)</i> and open it. It should take you directly to a download prompt on Prism Launcher.</li>
  <li>Hit launch and enter the server. That's it!</li>

</ul>
